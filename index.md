_I love data and do stuff with it._

I'm a Data Scientist, educated in Stats and ML, working in the field since 2013. 

I have an undergraduate degree in Economics from Bocconi University in Milan, a graduate degree in Statistics from Universita' La Sapienza in Rome, and a MSc in Machine Learning and Computational Statistics from University College London. Learned to code on the job; mainly Python, R and Scala. 

I've worked on extracting information from clinical trial abstracts using NLP and linear optimisation, personalising customer experience by optimising recommendations in e-commerce websites with contextual bandit algorithms and researching new ways in which the experience could be further personalised using Machine Learning, forecasting and reporting on key metrics for Mendeley Reference Manager and informing feature development by studying what made users stick for longer and come back, developing algorithms for detecting suspicoius activity and BOTs on Science Direct to prevent content misuse, improving recommenders and personalisation across Elsevier by inferring researchers' career journey, and many more smaller projects. 

Things that I'm enthusiastic about include, in random order: 
- NLP
- Bandit algorithms
- Bayesian optimisation
- Gaussian processes
- Statistical Learning Theory
- Anomaly detection

When I'm not thinking about the above, I am being a tourist somewhere, hiking and scrambling in the mountains like a goat (smelling like one too, sometimes), cycling in the summertime, playing the piano (those 2/3 pieces I still remember), reading mostly scifi, watching old films and baking.

I am from Italy, currently based in {{ site.author.location }}.
